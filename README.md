# Passport-Generator
This repository contains a simple passport generator application designed to focus on core functionality rather than design aesthetics. The app generates unique passport numbers and dates with basic form validation.

# Features:
- Customizable Design: Basic template provided. Customize the style as needed; the focus is on functional logic.
- Dynamic Release Date: Generates random past dates formatted as YYYY-MM-DD with a "years ago" notation (e.g., 2023-03-15 (2 years ago)).
- Unique Passport Numbers: Format is XXYY-XXXX-XXXX, where XX are the first two letters of the full name and YY are the first two digits of the ID card number. The remaining characters are random.
- Mobile Number Validation: Ensures the mobile number meets standard phone format requirements.
- Form Validation: Required fields must be completed before form submission.
- Static Image: Includes a placeholder image for the passport; replaceable with your own choice.

# Usage:
- Enter Information: Fill in the required fields (full name, ID card number, etc.).
- Generate Passport: Click "Generate" to create a passport with unique details.
- View and Manage: See the generated passport details and view recent passports.
